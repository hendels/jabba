# DOCKER
docker is a toll for running applications in an isolated environment
it gives advanteges similar to running your application inside a virtual machine:
1) your app runs in exactly the same environment, it always acts the same
2) working on multiple projects allows you to sandbox each one and keep them separate, good for security and eliminate a potential confilict between different projects
3) its easier to get going with somebody else's projects, dont have to install all dependencies and tools

* container - it behaves as virtual machine but its not, beceause it uses host machine kernel, not provide by virtual machines so it's more efficent, using less memory and disk space
